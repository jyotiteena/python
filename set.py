# set is collection of unordered items and must be unique and immutable

# list and dict can't store into set bcoz of both are mutable

num = {1,2,3,4,2}
print(num) #{1, 2, 3, 4}

# how to write empty set 
collection = {}
print(collection)
print(type(collection)) # this i dictionary 

set1 = set()
print(set1) #set()
print(type(set1)) #<class 'set'>
